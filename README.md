# MoMoney
Combining statistics gathered from popular rap songs in Misogyny Stats, with statistics on the most well paid hip hop artists to take a look at what values pay off.

# Salary vs. Misogyny

Inspired by the work of Ben Fry w/ Salary vs. Performance
This data visualization will look for correlation between use of
certain language and a hip hop artist's income. While it would
be ridiculous to take these stats as a direct correlation or or causation
I am curious to see what the correlation might be, if there is any,
and the kind of discussion it might spark if there is a correlation.
Best case scenario, rappers that respect women in their lyrics make
more money. Worst case scenario, the opposite would be true.
