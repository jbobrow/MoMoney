# Salary vs. Misogyny

Inspired by the work of Ben Fry w/ Salary vs. Performance(http://fathom.info/salaryper/). This data visualization will look for correlation between use of certain language and a hip hop artist's income. While it would be ridiculous to take these stats as a direct correlation or or causation, I am curious to see what the correlation might be, if there is any, and the kind of discussion it might spark if there is a correlation. Best case scenario, rappers that respect women in their lyrics make more money. Worst case scenario, the opposite would be true.
